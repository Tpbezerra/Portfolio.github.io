These are some of the bigger projects I have worked on.

This was a group project during my third year of university. We made a combat-based top-down game where dodging is the player's main way of avoiding damage. It was also decided that it would have an underwater motif taking place in a sunken city. The player controls a diesel-punk diver while fighting undead zombie-like enemies who are equipped with 3 different weapon types. At the end of the demo is a boss fight against a rock guardian.

This was my first group project in university where we decided to make a stealth game where you play as a pirate. The player has a cutlass and pistol with limited ammunition, these two tools allow him to dispatch enemies by sneaking up behind them or engaging in open combat. While very rudementary it taught me a lot about not only working with others over github but also more generally about how to program and structure projects for group work.

## [Unnamed Tower Defence Game](Tower Defence/TD.md)

This was a solo project during my first year in University where I programmed a tower defence game in the Unity game engine for a course called "Object-oriented game programming". The goal is to place towers around the map to halt the advcancement of enemies. There are four tower types each of which has 3 updgrade tiers.
