For this project I did most of the programming, this means everything except for the main menu UI, settings, and certain parts of the boids. I also did some modelling and spent a lot of time on the design of the game. <br />

Design: <br />
    For the gameplay, and specifically combat, design it was mainly me and one other member that worked on it to balance and make it fun. The in-game UI was a collaborative effort where I would desig something and then change it according to input. <br />

This project was very fun to work on and also very usefull as it was the first project that required a proper start and finish for a level with scaling difficulty and a fun gameplay-loop. It also made me much better at writing sustainable code that could be expanded upon at a later date. Finally it was the first project where I had to properly think about how to make the game balanced and really fun. This lead me to getting better at exploring and bringing forward game-feel. What I am most proud of with this is how scalable and maintainable the code is as it was easy to add new features and fix any bugs that crept up.
