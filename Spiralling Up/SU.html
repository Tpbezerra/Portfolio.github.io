        <h1>Spiralling Up</h1>
        <p>This is a small scale game for a third year bachelor's project. The player makes their way through multiple levels trying to reach an end door. Throughout the level are 
            different traps: pits, spikes, sawblades, and cannons. The player avoids these by utilising precise movement and if they reach the end within certain times they recieve 
            medals. This being a testing game however, the player's time and death count are being recorded throughout their play session and compared against other players. The 
            purpose of this being to attempt to find how graphical fidelity affects a player's perception of the game's difficulty.
