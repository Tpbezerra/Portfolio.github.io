    <p><b>I am a passionate programmer and highly enjoy problem solving. Making scalable, maintanable, and optimised software to be used and enjoyed by 
        others is a true love of mine.</b></p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I first studied programming in gymnasiet where I learned HTML, CSS and C#. While using C# I also used the Unity game engine to make prototypes for 
        games or just proofs of concept. Feeling that I had found what I really wanted to do I continued this path into Malm√∂ University where I studied 
        game development. During this program I learned even more C# and Unity and also began using some new languages such as C++, Java, and SQL. C++ 
        quickly became a favourite alongside C# as I really like the low-level control it gives.</p>

    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <h3>Lower-level languages</h3>
