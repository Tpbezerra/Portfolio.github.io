# Welcome

My name is Thomas Bezerra and this is my portfolio containing some of the projects I have worked on.

## Plundering Patrick


This was my first group project in university where we decided to make a stealth game where you play as a pirate. The player has a cutlass and pistol with limited ammunition, these two tools allow him to dispatch enemies by sneaking up behind them or engaging in open combat. While very rudementary it taught me a lot about not only working with others over github but also more generally about how to program and structure projects for group work.

## Unnamed Tower Defence Game

This was a solo project during my first year in University where I programmed a tower defence game in the Unity game engine for a course called "Object-oriented game programming". The goal is to place towers around the map to halt the advcancement of enemies. There are four tower types each of which has 3 updgrade tiers.
