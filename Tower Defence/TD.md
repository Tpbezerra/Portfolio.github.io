# Tower Defence

## Towers
As in other tower defence games you will attempt to fight off advancing enemies by placing towers of different types around the map. In this game there are 4 towers, a faster shooter for shorter range, a short range tower dealing AOE damage, a long range slower firing shooter, and a non-damaging slowing tower. The towers will prioritise firing damaging the enemies that are furthes along their paths.

Each tower also has three upgrades that will improve the performance of it by increasing stats such as firing speed, range, damage, and penetration.

Selling a tower will give back a percentage of the money invested into it. This includes the initial cost and all of the upgrade costs.

## Contributions
As this was a solo project I implemented everything alone. For this project I didn't make any custom models, instead making use of the sunoke shapes available in Unity. The features I implemented are:
    - Economy
    - Distinc towers and placement
    - Horde system
    - Upgrades
